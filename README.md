<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

This project implements a versatile **Text Summarizer** capable of condensing large bodies of text or web content into concise summaries. It serves as a comparative platform for various Extractive Summarization techniques, including frequency-based methods (SpaCy, NLTK) and graph-based algorithms (TextRank via Gensim, LexRank via Sumy).

Developed as a mini-project for the **8th Semester** curriculum, this system addresses the need for efficient information retrieval by automating the abstraction of key insights from documents. It features a Flask-based web interface that allows users to input raw text or URLs and visualize the comparative performance of different NLP models.

> [!NOTE]
> **Research Impact & Certification**
>
> This project was published as a research paper in the **International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET)** (Volume 10, Issue 1) and is also available as a preprint on **viXra**. The project received an official **Publication Certificate** for its research contribution to natural language processing.

> [!TIP]
> **Algorithm Selection for Optimal Results**
>
> For long-form documents, **Gensim's TextRank** provides superior coherence by leveraging graph-based sentence ranking. For shorter texts or news articles, **SpaCy's frequency-based** approach offers faster execution with comparable quality.
